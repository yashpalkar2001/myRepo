What is difference between library & framework?

library:-
	Libraries provide developers with predefined functions and classes to make their work easier and boost the development process.
    By using a library, you can control the flow of the application and call the library. 
    example:	JQuery, React JS, etc.

framework:-
    Framework, on the other hand, is like the foundation upon which developers build applications for specific platforms. 
    In contrast, when you use a framework, the control is inverted, i.e., the framework controls the flow and calls your code.
    example: vue.js , anguler.js
